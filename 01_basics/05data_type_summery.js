/*Note:
Java script is a dyanamiclly typed language.This means that you donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. Instead, the type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable. For example, you can assign a number to a variable and later assign a string to the same variable without any issues:

// there are two types of data types based on how they allocate in the memory
/* **********Primitive data types**********8
these are by call by value
types:
numbers, strings,bollean,symbol,null, undefined,BigInt

const anotId=Symbol(123)

/*These are by call by reference
types:
Array,objects,Functins

 const myFunction = function(){
